🎨 PCA & Dimensionality Reduction Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool to visualize how PCA (Principal Component Analysis) reduces 2D data into 1D while preserving maximum variance.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates PCA concepts through animations, projections, and a clean UI.

🚀 Features

Generates new random 2D datasets (elliptical distribution).

Shows the principal component (best-fit line).

Animates the projection of 2D points onto 1D axis.

Smooth transitions between original and reduced views.

Clean and modern UI with a dark theme.

Fully client-side — no backend required.
